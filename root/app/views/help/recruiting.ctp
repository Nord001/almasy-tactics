               Clicking the Recruit New Character button will randomize the base stats and stat growth of the character. Base stats are the initial values of a characterâ€™s stats. stat growth is how much of a stat a character gains per level.  Stat growth is much more important than base stat because it influences how the character will turn out later on.

               You'll also get to choose the name of your new character. Choose wisely, because you won't get to change it afterwards!

            <ul>
                <li>A stat growth of 5.5+ is usually satisfactory. Multiple stats with 5.5+ growth is excellent.
                <li>A stat growth of 6.3+ in either STR or INT is generally amazing for characters you plan to make attackers.
                <li>High VIT and LUK is recommended for characters for tanking (so they stay alive and enemies don't get critical hits them too much)
